# how to reproduce results:

0. Operating system: Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04

1. Install fastai(from terminal):
	a. conda create --name fastai-36 python=3.6
	b. source activate fastai-36
	c. pip install fastai==0.7.0pip
	d. pip install torchtext==0.2.3
	e. pip install torch==0.4.1

2. Folder structure:
	proteinAtlas--|-- input (this folder is provided in google drive)
		      |-- fastai (contains all scripts and model weights) 

2. Copy input data in 'input' folder (processed input data provided in google drive)
3. Copy trained model weights in 'fastai/models' directory (model weights provided in google drive)
4. Copy submissions from other team members and put them in 'fastai/sub_dir_team' folder.

4. Run predict_all.sh from fastai directory. This will create 2 submissions from shai models in 'fastai/subs'

5. Finally, two ensemble prediction, 'enstw36a.csv' and 'enstw39b1a.csv' will be created (fastai/sub_dir_team) using submissions from all team members, which will score around 0.640 in public LB. These two files were used in psudo labelling.
